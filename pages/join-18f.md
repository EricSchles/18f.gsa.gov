# What is 18F?

Technology changes fast. Americans have grown to expect fast, personalized information and services from the websites and apps they use on a daily basis. But with a shortage of in-house experts, budget limitations, and slow procurement processes, it can be hard for the Federal Government to meet those same expectations. This is where we (and hopefully you) come in.

Built in the spirit of America's top tech startups, 18F is a team of top-notch designers, developers, and product specialists inside the General Services Administration, headquartered at 18th & F Street NW, Washington, D.C. 18F is a digital consultancy **for** the U.S. Government **inside** the U.S. Government, working with federal agencies to rapidly deploy tools and online services that are reusable, cut costs, and are easier for people and businesses to use.

We've embarked on a mission to transform the way the U.S. Government builds and buys digital services. We're currently working with over a dozen different teams across the Federal Government to help them deliver on their agency's mission in a user-centered way. We will accomplish this by:

* putting the needs of the American people first;
* being design-centric, agile, open, and data-driven; and
* deploying early and often.


Weâ€™re transforming government from the inside out, creating cultural change by working in partnership with teams inside government agencies who want to create great services for the American people. 

## Our Strategy is Delivery

By delivering software in partnership with agencies, we teach by doing.  If there is process or policy that gets in the way of doing great work using modern practices, we work to fix that, and if needed, we can escalate roadblocks to the top of our agency or even to the White House.  

In addition to working with agency partners to create modern web products, we offer a host of other services which empower agencies to create their own digital services teams. These include workshops in agile project management and acquisition, conducting API usability testing for agency data services, and exporting our best practices in hiring and product deployment. 

## Our Work

18F believes in [transparent, collaborative work](http://18fblog.tumblr.com/post/93415834296/working-in-public-from-day-1) and accordingly all of our projects are open source and available to the public on [GitHub](https://github.com/18F). Our development team comprises over 50 technologists, including software developers, user experience designers, product managers, and more. We employ agile and lean methodologies to streamline delivery and ensure our products meet the needs of the people. To learn more about our current projects, visit our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/18F) or the [18F dashboard](http://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard), where we maintain a list of all of our current projects and their status.
